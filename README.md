# GMS Script Bank
CE Script Bank for Global MapleStory, powering [Nexon'd Trainer](https://github.com/md35-gk/Nexond-Trainer).

-----

## When posting/updating scripts:
- Use full names. "No Delay", not "ND"
- post scripts to their proper version folder so there's no need for commenting versions
- add an AoB wherever needed "12345678: //11 22 33 44"
- all scripts must be working for that version. If one does not, a **<not working>** tag must be written to the top of the script so Nexon'd Trainer can prevent users from using it.
